## Personal Statement
My short-term career goal is to pursue a role as a data analyst or data scientist within a software company, focusing on the fields of market and product analysis. Looking further ahead, my long-term objective is to collaborate with friends from different backgrounds to create an independent game.  

 Market analysis holds a crucial place in the success of software companies, particularly in the context of the rapidly evolving software market. There is fierce competition in the software market. In contrast to industries like clothing or other manufacturing, where changes in fashion might last for several decades. Software trends shift quickly. In order to attract new customers and retain existing users, any product, no matter how old, needs to update often to catch the lastest fashion. Video games are subject to this law as well. Steam, the largest video game platform globally, hosts a vast array of games, ranging from AAA to indie creations. With almost 30,000 games in its store, Steam's store leaderboard essentially reflects the current trends in the global gaming industry. This Steam game EDA looked at the video game industry. It's a sound method of conducting market research.
